# Github Hosted Blog

This is a Jekyll blog, forked from the easy to use Poole repo.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies

Poole is built on Jekyll and uses its built-in SCSS compiler to generate our CSS. Before getting started, you'll need to install the Jekyll gem and related dependencies:
```sh
$ gem install jekyll jekyll-gist jekyll-sitemap jekyll-seo-tag
```
Windows users: Windows users have a bit more work to do, but luckily @juthilo has your back with his [Run Jekyll on Windows guide](https://github.com/juthilo/run-jekyll-on-windows).

Need syntax highlighting? Poole includes support for Pygments or Rouge, so install your gem of choice to make use of the built-in styling. Read more about this in the Jekyll docs.

2a. Quick start

To help anyone with any level of familiarity with Jekyll quickly get started, Poole includes everything you need for a basic Jekyll site. To that end, just download Poole and start up Jekyll.

2b. Roll your own Jekyll site

Folks wishing to use Jekyll's templates and styles can do so with a little bit of manual labor. Download Poole and then copy what you need (likely _layouts/, *.html files, atom.xml for RSS, and assets/ for CSS, JS, etc.).

3. Running locally

To see your Jekyll site with Poole applied, start a Jekyll server. In Terminal, from /poole (or whatever your Jekyll site's root directory is named):
```sh
$ jekyll serve
```

Open http://localhost:4000 in your browser, and voil√†.
